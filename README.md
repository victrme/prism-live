# Prism Live

Editable code areas powered by [Prism](https://prismjs.com/).  
WIP, use at your own risk and do not assume that the API will not change.

$-----------$

- This implementation: [prism-live.pages.dev](https://prism-live.pages.dev)
- Original: [live.prismjs.com](https://live.prismjs.com)

## Install

```bash
npm install @victr/prism-live
```

Use a Prism theme stylesheet first
```html
<head>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="/prism.css" />
</head>
```

Import prism-live in a javascript file
```javascript
import "@victr/prism-live"
import "@victr/prism-live/prism-live.css"

// nothing else to do for now
```

Or in a script tag
```html
<head>
  <script type="module">
    import "@victr/prism-live";
    import "@victr/prism-live/prism-live.css" assert { type: "css" };
  </script>
</head>
```

Then create a code editor like this
```html
<textarea class="prism-live language-css" />
```

## Why

I needed a lightweight code-editor and chose prism-code-editor. But Prism live offers cool and annoying to implement features like auto indent or auto quotes! This is a working package based on the current development.

This will die once prism-live is available ðŸ˜²

## What changed

### Broken
- Did not check if line numbers styling is working, oops

### Development
- Use Prettier with config close to original formatting style
- Use v1 of prism and blissful as dependency (no tree shaking ðŸ˜¿)
- Package is only a minified ESM only build
- Built package using esbuild

### Demo
- Demo website as a static site generated by Vite
- Self hosted images and stylesheets
- No blissful in demo
- Constant strings as html/css/javascript example
